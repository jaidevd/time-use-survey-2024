# Microdata from the Time Use Survey 2024

This repository contains the microdata from the Time Use Survey conducted from
January 2024 to December 2024. The data set is in two parts, one for households
and one for persons, and is available in:

1. Raw fixed-width text formats (see the folder [`raw/`](./raw/))
2. Cleaned, more readable parquet tables (see the folder [`clean/`](./clean/))

The Python script and a data dictionary used for cleaning and formatting the
data is available for reuse and scrutiny.


## Note

The cleaning and reformatting logic is largely based on the [TUS 2024 documents](./docs/).
Please look for errors in the data, and let me know [here](https://github.com/jaidevd/time-use-survey-2024/issues/new).
